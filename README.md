# Band-Site Website
Band-Site is a Brainstation bootcamp project, this project took three weeks (one week counted as a sprint during the bootcamp)

Week five was when sprint three was completed and the site was delivered for a final evaluation. 

Five weeks into the bootcamp, it was time to be more involved into using HTML, SCSS, and vanilla JS (no React, or client/server structure). 

The site was also developed to be reactive and to change the format at three sizes: 
- less than 786 pixels > then use mobile formatting
- between 786 pixels and less than 1280 pixels > then use tablet formatting
- more than 1280 pixels > then use desktop formatting
